I am doing the internship at oasis infobyte under the data science domain, under that i have completed the 3 tasks which is given throughout the internship. For this full project work i have used the google colab which was a very amazing tool. More details is provided below.

Throughout the internship i have completed the 3 tasks:

TASK 1: Iris Flower classification

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements.Based on the sepal and petal length and width we are classifying the flower.wether the flower is blongs from setosaversicolor or virginica. By using the python and applies the machine learning alogorithm for training the model and generate the output. Requirements google colab libraries like :

numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib Model Used Logistic Regression

TASK 2: Email Spam Detection Using ML

Weâ€™ve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content. In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Requirments google colab libraries like :

numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib Model used Support Vector Machine TASK 3: Sales Prediction Using Python

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product. Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. Requirments libraries like :

numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib Model used Linear Regression Testing In each task after the training the model it is necessary to test our model. for that we compared the actual prediction with our prediction and try to get the higher acuuracy.
